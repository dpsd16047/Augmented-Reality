# Introduction
Building an AR application.

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
I downloaded a snow "js" file from the web, to put it in my code. Then I mentioned and fixed some parameters (of the snow) in the code. Afterwards, I mentioned the sphere and the cylinder - also fixed some parameters there. Added "annyang" for the voice control.

# 2nd Deliverable  
I've put 3D animations and graphics (H and O) with primitives. I've tried by coding to put those two letters together and when that happens, water comes out. I turned dpsd into a picture in this [site](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html?fbclid=IwAR2pgZdQl2eIMTjEwg90Ikrt5xyodSl80h8e89vuGiUbsrCmwLerEWWLenk). I then turned it into a pattern, downloaded it and finaly put it in the assets. Afterwards, I wrote *<a-marker type='pattern' url='assets\pattern-card-O.patt'>* and put the *...patt* in url. With *<a-entity ..... /a-entity>* i completed the animation and primitives for the 3D graphics (H and O). For the *dpsd* to show a text of the name: <a-text value="Christina Kontzinou" scale="2 2 1" position="0 0 0">. I created a script for the distance between H and O. And here's a [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100679305/168383478-8e5bb0f8-e4f2-4e18-87db-62e428048630.mp4)  

# 3rd Deliverable  
I built a model of the statue of E.Venizelos and it appears in his birthplace (mournies). It was converted from fbx to gtfl, otherwise it didn't work.
